    Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.

    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
        letters the secretWord contains.

    * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.

    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
        about whether their guess appears in the computers word.

    * After each round, you should also display to the user the
        partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the
        user has not yet guessed.

    Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
